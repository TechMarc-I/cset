I think the most difficult aspect of developing a project in a larger team will be communication. I feel that the larger the team is, the harder it will be to avoid situations where things are incorrectly communicated and things break because of it. I can imagine some situations occurring in which things break because two people went to work on the same code section and created lines of code that conflicted with each other. 

A remote is an external repository that is stored on some other computer that we as developers connect to and work on from our local computers. A brach can be described as  a series of commits that can converge and diverge or work in parallel with each other. In some cases, programmers work around one central main branch that all other branches diverge from or converge into. 

For the collaborative projects this week, we used the git feature branch workflow. This was employed by remoting into each group members repositories and then making a series of branches for each new feature we added or for every bug we fixed. We did this so that when sending pull requests, the owner of the repository would be allowed to pick and choose which changes he or she wanted to add to the main branch of the repository.
